# SnakeGame
Snake Game Project in Python
Snake Game Demo

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python. The game provides a nostalgic experience by allowing players to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while trying to eat as much food as possible.

Getting Started
To play the Snake Game, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This game was developed using Python 3, so make sure you have a compatible version.

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-python.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the newly cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd snake-game-python
Run the Game: Execute the Python script to start the game:

Copy code
python snake_game.py
Game Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction. The objective is to guide the snake to the food without colliding with the walls or its own body.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Your score will be displayed on the screen.

Game Features
Snake Movement: The snake moves in the direction specified by the player's key inputs.

Food Generation: Food appears at random positions on the screen. The snake grows longer each time it consumes food.

Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body. A collision results in the game ending.

Score Tracking: The player's score is displayed on the screen, indicating the number of food items consumed.

Customization
Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences. You can modify aspects such as the size of the game board, the speed of the snake, the appearance of the snake and food, and the conditions for winning or losing.
